//Assignment 4 - Question 1
//Q1. Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost, so that you can estimate how much 
//money could be saved by car pooling, which also has other advantages such as reducing carbon 
//emissions and reducing traffic congestion. The application should input the following information 
//and display the userâ€™s cost per day of driving to work: 
//a) Total miles driven per day. 
//b) Cost per gallon of gasoline. 
//c) Average miles per gallon. 
//d) Parking fees per day. 
//e) Tolls per day.
